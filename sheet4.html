      <h1>About the Narrative Visualisation</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Through the submitted Narrative Visualisation as a part of the CS413 Course, I wish to being the reader’s attention towards the Electricity access, consumption and extent of green energy the world produces and consumes. The narrative visualization has been designed with the idea in mind that the reader wishes to know the electricity scenario of different countries. This narrative visualization enables the reader to get an overview regarding the world’s electricity through data of various countries. </p>
    <h3>Narrative Structure</h3>
    <p class="lead">The submitted narrative visualization follows an ‘Interactive Slideshow’ structure. As a hybrid structure, the reader follows a directed path which introduces various scenes depicting graphs for the various countries of the world under the electricity scenario. During the slides, the user has the freedom to either drill down into further detail or even investigate some other tangent pertaining to the provided information if the reader is interested, or the reader can just choose to skip to the next slide. 

      Therefore, being implemented as an ‘Interactive Slideshow’ hybrid structure, the World’s Electricity narrative visualization provides the user with the freedom to explore the data and the visualizations. The visualization contains three different plots which provide various details about different countries of this world such as the population’s access to electricity, total population, electricity consumption, electricity generation from renewable sources, CO2 emissions etc. In the first two plots, the reader, if interested, can start to look at the details with a mouse-over and can drill down into some of the details. Further, in the last slide, the user has the freedom to analyse the trends in CO2 emissions and Renewable Energy consumption for the various countries by using the drop down menus. Thus, the implemented narrative visualization is a mix of the author led and reader led structure under the interactive slideshow model and enables the reader to move from slide to slide with the ability to investigate further in-between. 
      </p>
    <h3>Visual Structure</h3>
    <p class="lead">The World’s Electricity narrative visualization consists of four main scenes. Each of the scenes follows an easy to understand and consistent visual structure. The narrative visualization consists of a navigation bar at the top which enables the user to jump to the required scenes as per their preference. The first scene provides and overview information to the user (without any plot) and the ability to go to the next slide using the ‘next’ button. The second scene provides a brief of the data followed by a graphical visualization of the same where the user has the ability to drill down into the details. The user has the ability to go to the next slide using the ‘next’ button and to the previous slide using the ‘previous’ button. At any point, the user can jump to any slide using the universal navigation bar at the top. The third slide again provides a brief description followed by plot and the navigation buttons for the user to navigate forwards to backwards. The fourth slide is structured in a different way in order to enable the user to compare different countries on the basis of the data. It gives the choice to the user to select different countries from a drop down menu and plots the visualization on the basis of the selection. The user has the ability to go to the previous slide using the ‘previous’ button. 

      At each point, the user is able to transition through the visualization using either the navigation bar at the top or using the navigation buttons in the bottom of each slide. Each scenes connects the data in such a way which forms a coherent narrative visualization. The first scenes sets the stage by providing the overview, followed by two different scatter plots and then multiple line charts to enable the reader to understand the different data insights from the world’s electricity data scenario. The visual structure of this narrative visualizations enables the user to focus on the important aspect by making use of appropriate colour schemes and ensuring an easy to understand structure. 
      </p>
    <h3>Scenes</h3>
    <p class="lead">The the visualization contains the following scenes in the following order:<br><br>

      <b>1.	Overview – Electricity in this World</b><br>
      
      The first scene has been set up to give an overview to the reader regarding the narrative visualisation. As the Interactive Slide show is an hybrid stricture, this part of the visualization is author driven where the author sets the stage for the upcoming visualizations of the data. The placing of the overview slide at the beginning critical to the reader’s wholistic understanding of the visualization.<br><br>
      
      <b>2.	Access to Electricity</b><br>
      
      The second scenes provides information regarding the access of electricity to different countries across the world. In the scatter plot, each plotted datapoint represents a Country. The graph depicts a country's access to electricity as a percentage of the country's population on the vertical access and the country's population on the horizontal axis. Further, the countries have been group on the basis of their Income Group and each group has been depicted with different colours. The scene provides the inferences to the user and further leaves the user to derive their own inference from the visualization. Since access to electricity is a pivotal metric in understanding the World’s electricity, it is important to place this scene after the overview slide. <br><br>
      
      <b>3.	Consumption and Green Electricity</b><br>
      
      The third scenes allows the reader to go through electric power consumption of different countries in relation to their population and electricity production from renewable sources i.e. green electricity. The scene depicts a description and a visualization of the electric power consumption per capita (kWh) of the countries with respect to their population. We fail to see any observable trend between the population and per capita consumption, in fact, it seems to decline with increasing population. The variable size circles show the total amount of electric energy being generate by a specific country through renewable sources and the colour groups the countries by their regions. This scene emphasis on the countries’ electric power consumption and provides add on details through mouse over like the region etc. While it is also a scatter plot like the previous scenes, however, it makes use of variable size circles to plot the datapoints providing another dimension to the user. <br><br>
      
      <b>4.	CO2 Emissions and Renewable Energy Consumption</b><br>
      
      The fourth scenes allows the user to observe the trends from 1990 to 2015 regarding the CO2 emissions and Renewable Energy Consumption for different countries. The scenes enables users to select the counties for both the plots using a drop down menu and as soon as the reader selects the country, the trends graphs changes accordingly. The scene has been placed in the last to enable the reader to observe trends for different counties in detail after having an overview and broad idea from the previous scenes. 
      </p>
    <h3>Annotations</h3>
    <p class="lead">In the World’s Electricity Narrative Visualization, two different annotation templates have been utilized. First, the reader is provided the message as a description paragraph in each scene above the visualization. This message paragraph introduces the current scene to the use and conveys the message from the author. Second, scene 2 and scene 3 also make use of annotations within the visualization graph itself through the d3-annotation by Susie Lu. These annotations provide inferred messages to the reader based on the plots. 

      Each scene has a descriptive paragraphs annotation in the beginning to brief the reader for the upcoming visualization. These paragraphs introduce the reader to the core idea being portrayed by the plot. 
      
      The chart annotations have been utilized in scene 2 and 3 to provide inference to the readers from the charts. They highlight the regions of interest and provide details and inference regarding the regions. 
      
      The annotation do not change within a single scene. There seemed to be no need for changing annotations within a single scene and this this feature was not implemented in this visualization. The annotations which have been added in the scene support the overall visual consistency of the narrative visualization. 
      </p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p class="lead">The narrative visualization has the following parameters:<br><br>

      <b>Title :</b> Each scene has a title for the slide which can be treated as a variable scene element. This title, for example ‘Access to Electricity’, provide a brief to the reader regarding the scene. Based on the title, the reader gets a fair idea about the content of the scene and may either choose to skip or dive deeper into a particular scene. The state of the Title parameter is different for each scene and provides a summary of the scene. <br><br>
      
      <b>Scene</b> : Each scene which is the slide is a parameter in itself of the narrative visualization. As the reader makes use of the ‘next’ / ‘previous’ buttons, the user change the slide parameter and moves to the next slide. The state of the scenes are the different slides which are there in the narrative visualization. <br><br>
      
      <b>Trend Charts (in Scene 4) :</b> The trend charts of CO2 emissions and Renewable Energy Consumption in scene 4 are also parameters since the chart themselves change based upon the reader’s choice of country through the drop down menu. The states of the trend charts are the different charts for each of the countries based on the selection from the dropdown menu. <br><br>
      
      There may be other parameters present in this narrative visualization, such as the graphs in each scene can also be considered as parameters since the graphs change from slide to slide, however, the above mentioned parameters are one of the most important ones and have been used to convey the conceptual message in this essay. </p>
    
      <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p class="lead">The narrative visualization has the following parameters:

      The narrative visualization has the following parameters:<br><br>

      <b>Next & Previous Buttons :</b> The ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons serve as triggers for this narrative visualization which allow the user to change the state of the slide and navigate from one scene to another. These button enable the user to navigate through the entire narrative visualization by triggering the change in scene as per the users’ button click. <br><br>
      
      <b>Navigation Bar :</b> The navigation bar at the top of each scene also serves as a trigger to change the state of the slides to navigate through the different scenes in the narrative visualization. Each slides title variable is displayed on the navigation bar and the user can trigger the change of slide by clicking on the required title on the navigation bar. <br><br>
      
      <b>Country Selection Drop Down Menu (in scene 4) :</b> There are two drop down menus present in scene 4 which allows the user to select a country of their choice. Based on this selection, it triggers a change in the trend chart below the dropdown menu. Thus the change in the drop down menu changes the state of the chart based on the selected country. This trigger allowed to user to analyse the trends of different countries and derive inferences.
